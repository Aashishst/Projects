        <p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation).
            a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
            A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems, including simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, and factory devices like industrial robots.

        <h2> A Breif History</h2>   
        <p>In This Section we will learn about some of the <strong>"First Programmers"</strong>, <strong>"The Olden Computers"</strong> and more!</p>

        <h2>What we call as "The First Programmers"</h2>
        <h3>Very Early</h3>
        <p>One of the First Programmers we know is Augusta Ada King also Known as Ada Lovelace.
            She was an English Mathematician who had a high intrest in Computers and Math.
            We expect her to be the first Programmer as she was the first one develop a program to make a computic engine understand Bernoulli numbers.</p>
        <p>Another one of the First Programmers is Charles Babbage who was actually a close friend to Ada Lovelace.
           Babbage is considered by some to be "Father of the Computer". He is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer, the Difference Engine.
           Which led to many of todays Computers.
        </p>
        <h3>Early</h3>
        <p>Grace Hopper was a important role in the Programming evalution as she has Developed the first compiler for a programming language and popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages. 
            She played a key role in the development of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language).</p>
